abstract = {Abstract The initial value problem for the modified Vlasov equation with a mollification parameter δ > 0, as introduced by Batt, has a unique global solution in the weak sense whenever f0 ε L1 and f0 ≧ 0 λ-a.e. Assuming boundedness of f0 and boundedness of the kinetic energy, it is shown that, as δ → 0, there are subsequences δn → 0 such that the corresponding solutions converge weakly in the measure-theoretical sense. The limits are shown to be global weak solutions of the initial value problem for Vlasov's equation, and these solutions are seen to be weakly continuous with respect to t. For the plasma physical case, boundedness of the kinetic energy is a consequence of energy conservation.},

Our continuation criteria is an improvement in the 1≤r≤2 range to the previously best known criteria ‖p04r−1+βf‖Lt∞LxrL1p≲1 due to Kunze [7]. We also consider continuation criteria when f(0,x,p) has noncompact support. In this regime, Luk–Strain [9] proved that ‖p0θf‖Lx1Lp1≲1 is a continuation criteria for θ>5. We improve this result to θ>3. Finally, we build on another result by Luk–Strain [8]. The authors proved boundedness of momentum support on a fixed two-dimensional plane is a sufficient continuation criteria. We prove the same result even if the plane varies continuously in time."

It is here shown that this difficulty is of purely mathematical origin, and can be overcome by a proper treatment. This treatment leads to a complete set of stationary solutions, which are much more numerous than the usual plasma oscillations. In particular, their wave lengths and frequencies are not connected by a dispersion equation, but independently assume all real values. Special superpositions of these stationary solutions correspond to the usual plasma oscillations. They constitute slightly damped plane waves, which do obey the dispersion equation (2), the integral being interpreted as a Cauchy principal value. An arbitrary initial distribution behaves (after a short transient time) like a superposition of such waves, as far as the density is concerned.},

	abstract = {We study the spectral theory of the linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation, in order to prove that its solution behaves, for large times, like a sum of plane waves. To obtain such an expansion involving damped waves, we must find an analytical extension of the resolvent of the equation. Then, the poles of this extension are no longer eigenvalues and must be interpreted as eigenmodes, associated to ``generalized eigenfunctions'' which actually are linear functionals on a Banach space of analytic functions.},
